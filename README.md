# First steps into the testing world of Python
- A report on learning Software Testing

At first sight, tests may seem confusing and even a bit scary. There are many tools, multiple test levels, different approaches, and techniques. In this talk I want to share my 30-days report of learning to test Python applications; the challenges I found, some cool resources that helped me, and the questions I had (or still have).
